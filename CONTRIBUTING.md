# Contributing

I am just one developer.  I can certainly address all the issues that pop up, but would definitely appreciate contributions from others.

## Getting Started
1. Have a GitHub account
2. Fork the project
3. Make sure you have npm, grunt, and grunt tasks set up and running correctly
4. Submit a GitHub issue for the Bug/Enhancement
   * Clearly describe the issue
   * Please include a reproducer

## Making Changes
1. Make the necessary changes
2. Run Grunt to make sure all the linting passes
3. Add necessary unit tests to cover your bug fix or feature
4. Make sure Karma passes with your new unit test(s)
5. Make sure your commit follows the idiomatic guidelines
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.
 
 **Type** must be one of the following
  ```
  feat: A new feature
  fix: A bug fix
  docs: Documentation only changes
  style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
  perf: A code change that improves performance
  test: Adding missing tests
  chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
  ```
6. Submit a Pull Request
